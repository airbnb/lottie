### üòç Additional goodies üòç
All of these goodies are highly recommended. They arent essential, because you can still create for Lottie without them. But your workflow will be significantly faster and better with these extra tools.

[Explode shape layers](http://aescripts.com/explode-shape-layers/) is a fantastic tool created by [Zack Lovatt ](https://twitter.com/zlovatt?lang=en)for after effects that helps in the conversion of illustrator files to shape layers. Highly recommended!

[Sketch2AE](https://google.github.io/sketch2ae/) is an amazing new tool from the [Google SUMux](https://design.google/) team. It assists in bringing artwork from Sketch to After Effects

[Parametric converter](https://www.kyle-martinez.com/tools/parametric-converter/) made by [Kyle Martinez](https://twitter.com/kyletmartinez) converts bezier shapes to parametric shapes. Its super helpfup when you have an illustrator file that has elipses or rectangles as paths, and you need them converted to the parametric shapes with size controls etc.
