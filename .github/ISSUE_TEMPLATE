This repo is NOT for reporting issues on the individual libraries.
If you are looking for them, view the README for links to the individual libraries.

This repo is for the docs at https://airbnb.io/lottie. Proposing changes to the docs is ridiculously easy. Please follow the directions on the README. You don't even need to know git or use a terminal to update the docs. You can do it right from your browser.

Issues reported here are not checked regularly and will probably not get you very far.
