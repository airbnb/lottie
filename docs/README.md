Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders them natively on mobile!

For the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so here are 13,000:

All of these animations were created in After Effects, exported with Bodymovin, and rendered natively with no additional engineering effort.

[Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) is an After Effects plugin created by Hernan Torrisi that exports After effects files as json and includes a javascript web player. We've built on top of his great work to extend its usage to Android, iOS, and React Native.
