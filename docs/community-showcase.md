## SwiftKey
SwiftKey iOS is using Lottie to help guide their users through the installation of a third party keyboard. With Lottie, they are able to easily control the colours to make their animations high contrast for accessibility, and they're able to scale up to the size of an iPad without losing quality. On a side note, they recently swapped out an old school png sequence which was about 6mb in size, for a lottie json that is just 340kb!
